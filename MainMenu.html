        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>
            Ecolamity is a video game which attempts to create a 2D grid-based simulation of the 
            ecosystems of various natural environments.   Each environment has a specific set of 
            species that cohabit and interact with each other.   Each species has its own defined 
            AI which dictates its behavior and interactions with other species.  Among these 
            behaviors include movement, hunting, and reproduction.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The player of the game selects the type and size of the environment, followed by 
            selectively placing various creatures of their choosing on any location on the map.  
            Once the game begins, the player observes the behavior of the creatures they placed 
            on the map.  The goal of Ecolamity is to create an ecosystem that flourishes over time, 
            in which varying species can coexist without extinction or the dominance of a single 
            species.  If all creatures on the map die or only plantation remains in the ecosystem, 
            then the game ends in failure.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Info</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The player creates their desired simulation on the Map Edit Screen, which allows 
                them to choose the environment, size of the map, types of creatures, and their positions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Environments can potentially have obstacles on the map, which will prevent creatures 
                from moving to tiles containing them.  The number of obstacles placed on the map is 
                determined by the environment, each of which has a dedicated percentage that dictates 
                how much of the map will be covered in obstacles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Time will be expressed by in-game hours. Every 24 hours an in-game day goes by.
            </li>
            <li>
                During the game, a sidebar will be shown which displays the current game time and 
                contains a user interface for the player to interact with certain game features such 
                as pausing the game, adjusting the game speed, or returning back to the Map Edit screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                During the game, the stats of every creature will be displayed on the sidebar.  
                These stats include age, day born, food meter, and creatures killed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game ends once all creatures on the map are dead or if only plant-life remains.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Creature Info</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All creatures have a lifespan dictated by their species.  A creature will pass 
                away if their age surpasses its lifespan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Animals have a “food meter”, which expresses their hunger level.  It ranges from 
                0 to 4 and by default starts on 3 at the beginning of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                When an animal hunts prey, it kills and eats them. This will raise their food meter by 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                The food meter depletes over time if food is not eaten, decrementing by 1 every 2 days 
                (by default) since the animal’s last meal.  An animal will die of starvation if their food 
                meter reaches 0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Animals will also not hunt prey if their food meter is equal to 4.
            </li>
            <li>
                There will be a cool-down time after an animal eats, so that it does not attempt to 
                hunt more prey and eat more food until the cool-down time has ended. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Every animal species has a list of predators and prey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plants get nourishment through photosynthesis; therefore they do not need to search for 
                food. They get nourishment over time, thus they do not have a food meter.
            </li>
            <li>
                All creatures reach an age of maturity within a certain percentage of their lifespan.  
                The percentage is dictated by the species.  A creature at age of maturity becomes 
                capable of reproducing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plants reproduce asexually. Number of children produced depends on the species.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two animals of the same species reproduce sexually. The number of children 
                produced depends on the species.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a cool-down time after a creature has reproduced before it can reproduce again.
            </li>
        </ul>
